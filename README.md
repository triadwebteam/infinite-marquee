# Infinite Marquee

This project creates an infinite marquee effect using HTML and CSS. The marquee displays a repeating series of text elements that continuously scroll from right to left, creating an eye-catching animation. The project uses custom styling to ensure smooth and visually appealing movement, and it incorporates accessibility considerations for users who prefer reduced motion.

## Features

- **Infinite Scrolling:** The marquee content scrolls infinitely, creating a seamless loop.
- **Custom Styling:** Uses the "Bebas Neue" font from Google Fonts and specific styling to enhance the visual appeal.
- **Accessibility:** The marquee respects the user's `prefers-reduced-motion` setting to reduce or pause the animation if necessary.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout is designed to be responsive and looks good on various screen sizes.

## Usage

## Customization
You can customize the content of the marquee by changing the list items inside the marquee-content class. Additionally, you can adjust the scrolling speed by modifying the animation property in the CSS.
